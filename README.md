This repository includes implementations of several key algorithms and concepts taught in the Operating Systems course:

1. **Banker's Algorithm**
2. **Memory Management Algorithms**
   - Paging
   - Segmentation
3. **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**
   - First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
   - Shortest Job Next (SJN)
   - Priority Scheduling
   - Round Robin (RR)
   - Multilevel Queue Scheduling
4. **Process Synchronization Algorithms**
   - Dining Philosophers Problem
   - Readers-Writers Problem
   - Producer-Consumer Problem
